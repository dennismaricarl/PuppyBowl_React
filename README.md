<div>
The Puppy Bowl is an existing project with an incomplete front end. I built the functional client-side using existing API and successfully rendered a puppy bowl roster where users can view all puppies, observe puppy details, add and remove puppies.

<h6> API:  https://fsa-puppy-bowl.herokuapp.com/api/ </h6>
<h4>Tools and Technologies used: React, React-Router, Vite, CSS </h4> 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h4>Goals achieved for this project: </h4>
1. Player list: Users can see a list of each player competing in the bowl. <br/>
2. Details: Users can click a details button on each puppy that will lead them to another page view with specific details on that puppy. <br/>
3. Search Bar: Users can search for a specific player in a search bar and see a new list of players with names matching the text in the search bar.<br/>
4. New Player Form: There is a form to create a new player and it gets added to the all players list without refreshing the page.
